# Deep Learning Practice
This repository contains python code to implement basic deep learning models that I learned during Fall 2022. The textbooks I followed were:
1. [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow for theory.
2. [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) by Fran√ßois Chollet to practice implementation using Keras and TensorFlow.
